#An enterprise wifi account management system
I've been researching enterprise-grade wireless account management solutions. While 802.1x and FreeRADIUS are effective, configuring FreeRADIUS is notoriously complex due to its lack of a graphical user interface. To address this, I've developed a user-friendly WiFi account management system specifically designed for FreeRADIUS.

Here are its key features:

1. **Organizational Structure Alignment:** The system mirrors your company's organizational structure for intuitive network management.
2. **Seamless Office Roaming:** A single account grants access across all company offices, regardless of location.
3. **TLS Certificate-Based Encryption:** Secure communication through certificates, with easy upload functionality for certificate files.
4. **Centralized Multi-NAS Management:**  Unified control over multiple Network Access Servers (NAS) across geographically dispersed offices.
5. **Flexible User Account Control:** Easily manage user permissions and organizational affiliations using priority-based organization settings.
6. **Intuitive Statistical Charts:** Visualize certification and accounting data through insightful charts and graphs.
7. **User VLAN Management:** Assign VLANs to users via RADIUS, enabling differentiated DHCP and IP address allocation.
8. **OpenLDAP Integration for Extended Authentication:** Integrate with OpenLDAP for streamlined authentication across multiple applications, allowing for both RADIUS and LDAP authentication with a single action. 
9. **Third-Party System Integration:** Connect with existing systems like OA and ERP for automated employee onboarding and offboarding, streamlining network account management.
10. **Automated Reporting and Monitoring:** Receive real-time alerts and reports via integrated chatbot notifications for proactive issue identification and resolution.
11. **Granular System Permissions:**  Enhance security and control with customizable administrator roles and permissions.
